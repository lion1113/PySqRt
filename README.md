Square Root Calculator
A simple Python 3 application to calculate the square root of a given number. This calculator provides control over the desired accuracy of the result.

Description
This project implements a basic square root calculator using Python 3. It allows users to input a number and retrieve its square root, with the flexibility to specify the precision of the output.

Features
Calculates the square root of non-negative numbers.

Allows customization of result accuracy (number of decimal places).

Easy to use from the command line or integrate into other Python scripts.

How to Use
Save the script:
Save the provided Python code (which you would write, e.g., sqrt_calculator.py) to a file on your local machine.

Run from terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using Python 3:

python3 sqrt_calculator.py

The script will then prompt you to enter a number and specify the desired accuracy.

Accuracy
The accuracy of the square root result is defined by the number of decimal places. When you specify N as the desired accuracy, the calculator will attempt to compute the square root such that it is correct to N decimal places. This means the absolute difference between the calculated value and the true square root will be less than 0.5×10 
−N
 .

Example:

If accuracy = 2, the result will be accurate to two decimal places (e.g., 1.41 for  
2
​
 ).

If accuracy = 5, the result will be accurate to five decimal places (e.g., 1.41421 for  
2
​
 ).

Internally, the calculation likely uses an iterative method (e.g., Newton's method or binary search) that refines the approximation until the desired precision is met. The number of iterations will depend on the input number and the required accuracy.

Example Usage (Hypothetical Script Interaction)
Enter a number to calculate its square root: 16
Enter desired accuracy (number of decimal places, e.g., 5): 3
The square root of 16.0 with 3 decimal places is: 4.000

Enter a number to calculate its square root: 2
Enter desired accuracy (number of decimal places, e.g., 5): 7
The square root of 2.0 with 7 decimal places is: 1.4142136
